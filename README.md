<h1 align="center">My frontend journey</h1>

Hey! This is the repository for my frontend journey, I always said that frontend wasn't my thing, but after I video from Akita (A brazilian youtuber) he said that people that only sticks with one thing (front or back) will be left back (which makes total sense) so I decided to face my fear!

FYI not all my learning is kept in this repository, I might know more but I just don't feel saving in here for being too easy in my opinion. And also I keep a separate text file to all my learnings
